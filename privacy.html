        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="updated">Last Updated: February 2026</p>

        <p>
            Edgin (“we,” “our,” or “us”) values your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect,
            use, and protect your information when you use the <strong>Edgin</strong> mobile application
            (“App”).
        </p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3>a. Information You Provide</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Email address</strong> – used for authentication, AI usage tracking, and user support.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>User-generated content</strong> – messages or text you submit for AI-powered ski video analysis.

        </ul>

        <h3>b. Automatically Collected Information</h3>
        <p>
            When you use the App, certain information is collected automatically through third-party services:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Usage data</strong> (Firebase Analytics), such as app interactions and feature usage
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Crash and performance data</strong> (Firebase Crashlytics) for diagnosing errors and improving stability
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Device advertising identifier (IDFA)</strong> (Meta/Facebook SDK) – collected only with your explicit consent via Apple's App Tracking Transparency (ATT) prompt. Used solely for ad attribution and measuring the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. If you do not grant permission, this identifier is not collected.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>App events</strong> (Meta/Facebook SDK), such as app installs and app launches, used for ad campaign measurement and optimization
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This data is collected in an aggregated and anonymized manner where possible.
        </p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use your information to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide AI-powered ski video analysis features</li>
            <li>Authenticate users and manage accounts</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Sharing and Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            We do <strong>not sell your personal data</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            We may share information only with trusted third-party service providers necessary to operate the App,
            including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Firebase Authentication</li>
            <li>Firebase Analytics</li>
            <li>Firebase Crashlytics</li>
            <li>AI service providers for processing analysis requests</li>
            <li>Meta/Facebook SDK for ad attribution and campaign measurement</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These providers are required to protect your data in accordance with their own privacy policies
            and applicable laws.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Advertising and Tracking</h2>
        <p>
            We use the Meta (Facebook) SDK to measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns.
            On iOS, we request your permission through Apple's App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework
            before accessing your device's advertising identifier (IDFA).
        </p>
        <p>
            You may choose to allow or deny tracking when prompted. If you deny tracking, we will not
            access your IDFA, and ad measurement will rely on privacy-preserving methods such as Apple's
            SKAdNetwork. Your choice does not affect your ability to use any features in the App.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can change your tracking preference at any time in your device's Settings under
            Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Tracking.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
            We retain personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this
            Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required by law.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
        <p>
            We use reasonable, industry-standard security measures to protect your information.
            However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Your Privacy Rights</h2>
        <p>
            Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, or delete your personal data,
            or to withdraw consent where applicable.
        </p>
